How to Contribute \u00b6 See CONTRIBUTING.md Developement Environment \u00b6 Run API Server \u00b6 The API server will connect to the Kubeflow cluster from your current kubectl context. See Connecting a Kubeflow cluster below for options. Install Go Change directory to project root: cd jupyter-apis Run go run . -spawner-config samples/spawner_ui_config.yaml (or use an alternative YAML config) Run Front-End \u00b6 The front-end is configured to proxy requests to the local API server. It requires an environment variable ( KF_USER_ID ) to specify the current user \u2013 this is passed to the API server as an HTTP header. Change directory to front-end folder: cd frontend Install dependencies: npm install Run the front-end KF_USER_ID=<cloud_email> npm start The front-end is now available at http://localhost:4200/jupyter/ . Since it is disconnected from the centraldashboard component, you need to type your desired namespace in the UI rather than selecting it from a dropdown. Connecting a Kubeflow Cluster \u00b6 The API server will connect to the Kubeflow cluster from your current kubectl context. Here are a couple options for setting that up. Local miniKF Cluster (Preferred) \u00b6 This deploys a Kubeflow cluster on your local machine and requires at least 50GB of disk space and the recommanded RAM is 12 Gb. First, create the miniKF cluster: Install Vagrant and Virtual Box. Create a new directory and run vagrant init arrikto/minikf and then vagrant up (takes about 20 minutes to boot). Navigate to http://10.10.10.10 . Follow on-screen steps to start Kubeflow and Rok (takes about another 20 minutes). From here, you can use Kubeflow and Rok. Then configure kubectl to connect to your new cluster: Download the miniKF kubectl config file from http://10.10.10.10 . Use the downloaded configuration for kubectl , either replacing, or merging it into, ~/.kube/config . Ensure kubectl config current-context is pointing to your local cluster. Your KF_USER_ID can be the default user that was created for your miniKF cluster (typically user ). Each time you need to start the cluster, navigate to the directory you created and run vagrant up . Note : after some experimentation, it was found that the vagrant file could be modified on line 57 to use 8gb instead of the default 12. config . vm . provider \" virtualbox \" do | vb | # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine # vb . gui = true # Customize the amount of memory on the VM : vb . memory = \" 8192 \" end Remote AKS Cluster \u00b6 Install Azure CLI az and kubectl Login with az and set your subscription Run az aks get-credentials for the desired remote cluster Ensure kubectl config current-context is pointing to the correct AKS cluster License \u00b6 Unless otherwise noted, the source code of this project is covered under Crown Copyright, Government of Canada, and is distributed under the MIT License .

Introduction \u00b6 Our Container images are based on the community driven jupyter/docker-stacks . This enables us to focus only on the additional toolsets that we require to enable our data scientists. Usage \u00b6 Generating Dockerfiles \u00b6 Use make generate-dockerfiles to generate all Dockerfile s. These will be written to ./output/imagename , along with any required files for the build context Building and Tagging Docker Images \u00b6 Use make build/IMAGENAME to build an already generated (see above) Dockerfile . This by default generates images with: * repo=k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io * tag=BRANCH_NAME For example: k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:BRANCH_NAME . make build also accepts arguments for REPO and TAG to override these behaviours. For example, make build/jupyterlab-cpu REPO=myrepo TAG=notLatest . make post-build/IMAGENAME is meant for anything that is commonly done after building an image, but currently only adds common tags. It adds tags of SHA, SHORT_SHA, and BRANCH_NAME to the given image, and accepts a SOURCE_FULL_IMAGE_NAME argument if you're trying to tag an existing image that has a non-typical name. For example: * make post-build/IMAGENAME will apply SHA, SHORT_SHA, and BRANCH_NAME tags to k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:BRANCH_NAME (eg: using the default REPO and TAG names) * make post-build/IMAGENAME SOURCE_FULL_IMAGE_NAME=oldRepo/oldImage:oldTag REPO=newRepo will make the following new aliases for oldRepo/oldImage:oldTag REPO=newRepo : * newRepo/IMAGENAME:SHA * newRepo/IMAGENAME:SHORT_SHA * newRepo/IMAGENAME:BRANCH_NAME Pulling and Pushing Docker Images \u00b6 make pull/IMAGENAME and make push/IMAGENAME work similarly to make build/IMAGENAME . REPO and TAG arguments are available to override their default values. Note: To use make pull or make push , you must first log in to ACR ( az acr login -n k8scc01covidacr ) Note: make push by default does docker push --all-tags in order to push the SHA, SHORT_SHA, etc., tags. Testing images \u00b6 Running and Connecting to Images Locally/Interactively \u00b6 To test an image interactively, use make dev/IMAGENAME . This docker run 's a built image, automatically forwarding ports to your local machine and providing a link to connect to. Automated Testing \u00b6 Automated tests are included for the generated Docker images using pytest . This testing suite is modified from the docker-stacks test suite. Image testing is invoked through make test/IMAGENAME (with optional REPO and TAG arguments like make build ). Testing of a given image consists of general and image-specific tests: \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests \u251c\u2500\u2500 general # General tests applied to all images \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 some_general_test.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 jupyterlab-cpu # Test applied to a specific image \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 some_jupyterlab-cpu-specific_test.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 jupyterlab-tensorflow Where tests/general tests are applied to all images, and tests/IMAGENAME are applied only to a specific image. Pytest will start the image locally and then run the provided tests to determine if Jupyterlab is running, python packages are working properly, etc. Tests are formatted using typical pytest formats (python files with def test_SOMETHING() functions). conftest.py defines some standard scaffolding for image management, etc. General Development Workflow \u00b6 Modifying Dockerfiles (local testing) \u00b6 Clone the repo (optional) make pull/IMAGENAME TAG=SOMEEXISTINGTAG to pull an existing version of the image you are working on (this could be useful as a build cache to reduce development time below) Change an image via the docker-bits that are used to create it, not the files in the output/ folder . Same goes for the shell scripts and json files - they should be modified from the resources folder. For quick-iteration debugging you can directly edit the ./output files, but make sure you commit any changes you want to keep back to the ./docker-bits After making your changes, generate new Dockerfiles through make generate-dockerfiles Build your edited image using make build/IMAGENAME (or, if you pulled a version of it above, you can use make build/IMAGENAME DARGS=\"--cache-from SOMEOLDREPO/SOMEOLDIMAGE:SOMETAG\" , which will use layers from the pulled image as cached layers if possible, speeding up your build) Test your image: using automated tests through make test/IMAGENAME manually by docker run --it -p 8888:8888 REPO/IMAGENAME:TAG , then opening it in http://localhost:8888 Modifying Dockerfiles (on-platform testing) \u00b6 GitHub Actions CI is enabled to do building, scanning, automated testing, and (optionally) pushing of our images to ACR. Build, test, and scan CI triggers on: * any push to master * any push to an open PR This allows for easy scanning and automated testing for images. GitHub Actions CI also enables pushing built images to our ACR, making them accessible from the platform. This occurs on: * any push to master * any push to an open PR that also has the auto-deploy label on the PR This allows developers to opt-in to on-platform testing. For example, when you need to build in github and test on platform (or want someone else to be able to pull your image): * open a PR and add the auto-deploy label * push to your PR and watch the GitHub Action CI * access your image in Kubeflow via a custom image from any of: * k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:SHA * k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:SHORT_SHA * k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:BRANCH_NAME Adding new Images \u00b6 Dockerfiles are defined using make with recipes defined in the Makefile . They pull segments of Dockerfile s from docker-bits and assemble them. All output images should meet the following criteria: be generated by calling make generate-dockerfiles have outputs written to output/imagename , where imagename is a valid Docker image name (eg: all lowercase, no special characters) To add new images, edit the makefile such that it generates the ./output/imagename directory. You can usually follow the existing recipes (or even add an extra piece to them), or you can add a whole new make target (but make sure to add your new target to make generate-dockerfiles as well). Modifying and Testing CI \u00b6 If making changes to CI that cannot be done on a branch (eg: changes to issue_comment triggers), you can: * fork the 'kubeflow-containers' repo * Modify the CI with * REGISTRY: (your own dockerhub repo, eg: \"j-smith\" (no need for the full url)) * Change - uses: azure/docker-login@v1 with: login-server: ${{ env.REGISTRY_NAME }}.azurecr.io username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} to - uses: docker/login-action@v1 with: username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} * In your forked repo, define secrets for REGISTRY_USERNAME and REGISTRY_PASSWORD with your dockerhub credentials (you should use an API token, not your actual dockerhub password) Note: Since pushing comes right at the end of the CI, in many cases you don't need to have a valid registry to test the CI on a fork. It will fail on the push step, but all other steps will clearly work and you can know it should safely merge back into the main repo. Other Development Notes \u00b6 Set User File Permissions after Every pip / conda Install or Edit of User's Home Files \u00b6 The Dockerfiles in this repo are intended to construct compute environments for a non-root user jovyan to ensure the end user has the least privileges required for their task, but installation of some of the software needed by the user must be done as the root user. This means that installation of anything that should be user editable (eg: pip and conda installs, additional files in /home/$NB_USER , etc.) will by default be owned by root and not modifiable by jovyan . Therefore we must change the permissions of these files to allow the user specific access for modification. For example, most pip install/conda install commands occur as the root user and result in new files in the $CONDA_DIR directory that will be owned by root and cause issues if user jovyan tried to update or uninstall these packages (as they by default will not have permission to change/remove these files). To fix this issue, end any RUN command that edits any user-editable files with: fix-permissions $CONDA_DIR && \\ fix-permissions /home/$NB_USER This fix edits the permissions of files in these locations to allow user access. Note that if these are not applied in the same layer as when the new files were added it will result in a duplication of data in the layer because the act of changing permissions on a file from a previous layer requires a copy of that file into the current layer. So something like: RUN add_1GB_file_with_wrong_permissions_to_NB_USER.sh && \\ fix-permissions /home/$NB_USER would add a single layer of about 1GB, whereas RUN add_1GB_file_with_wrong_permissions_to_NB_USER.sh RUN fix-permissions /home/$NB_USER would add two layers, each about 1GB (2GB total).

Note: go-get or vendor this package as github.com/StatCan/kubeflow-controller . This particular example demonstrates how to perform basic operations such as: How to register a new custom resource (custom resource type) of type Profile using a CustomResourceDefinition. How to create/get/list instances of your new resource type Profile . How to setup a controller on resource handling create/update/delete events. It makes use of the generators in k8s.io/code-generator to generate a typed client, informers, listers and deep-copy functions. You can do this yourself using the ./hack/update-codegen.sh script. The update-codegen script will automatically generate the following files & directories: pkg/apis/kubeflowcontroller/v1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go pkg/generated/ Changes should not be made to these files manually, and when creating your own controller based off of this implementation you should not copy these files and instead run the update-codegen script to generate your own. Details \u00b6 The kubeflow controller uses client-go library extensively. The details of interaction points of the kubeflow controller with various mechanisms from this library are explained here . Fetch kubeflow-controller and its dependencies \u00b6 Like the rest of Kubernetes, kubeflow-controller has used godep and $GOPATH for years and is now adopting go 1.11 modules. There are thus two alternative ways to go about fetching this demo and its dependencies. Fetch with godep \u00b6 When NOT using go 1.11 modules, you can use the following commands. go get -d github.com/StatCan/kubeflow-controller cd $GOPATH /src/github.com/StatCan/kubeflow-controller godep restore When using go 1.11 modules \u00b6 When using go 1.11 modules ( GO111MODULE=on ), issue the following commands --- starting in whatever working directory you like. git clone https://github.com/statcan/kubeflow-controller.git cd kubeflow-controller Note, however, that if you intend to generate code then you will also need the code-generator repo to exist in an old-style location.

Purpose \u00b6 This controller updates the state of Vault to allow access to secrets from OIDC users and from inside a profile's namespace. Running \u00b6 Prerequisite : Since the kubeflow-controller uses apps/v1 deployments, the Kubernetes cluster version should be greater than 1.9. # assumes you have a working kubeconfig, not required if operating in-cluster go build -o kubeflow-controller . ./kubeflow-controller -kubeconfig = $HOME /.kube/config # create a CustomResourceDefinition kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/crd.yaml # create a custom resource of type Profile kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/example-profile.yaml # check deployments created through the custom resource kubectl get deployments Use Cases \u00b6 CustomResourceDefinitions can be used to implement custom resource types for your Kubernetes cluster. These act like most other Resources in Kubernetes, and may be kubectl apply 'd, etc. Some example use cases: Provisioning/Management of external datastores/databases (eg. CloudSQL/RDS instances) Higher level abstractions around Kubernetes primitives (eg. a single Resource to define an etcd cluster, backed by a Service and a ReplicationController) Cleanup \u00b6 You can clean up the created CustomResourceDefinition with: kubectl delete crd profiles.kubeflow.org Link \u00b6 kubeflow-controller","title":"kubeflow-controller"},{"location":"Kubeflow%20Controller/#kubeflow-controller","text":"This repository implements a simple controller for watching Profile resources as defined with a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD).

Do one of the following: (Optional but appreciated - this will speed up our review/release process.) Test your dashboard against the central shiny implementation by following the Deployment Testing Instructions section below. In particular, identify any packages that are missing from the shiny repo and note them in the text of your PR. Check this packages file to see if all R packages you use are included in the list.
